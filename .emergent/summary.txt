**what currently exists?**
A full-stack car dealership website for J.R Autos has been built using a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database.

- **Frontend**: A fully responsive, dark-themed, bilingual (English/Spanish) site with Home, Inventory, Services, About, and Contact pages. It features a vehicle detail page with a multi-image gallery for each car and inventory filtering by brand and body type.
- **Backend**: A FastAPI server provides API endpoints for vehicle CRUD operations and handling contact form submissions.
- **Database**: MongoDB stores vehicle listings and contact form messages.
- **Integrations**:
    - **Resend**: Integrated for sending email notifications to the admin when a contact form is submitted.
    - **Google Maps**: Embedded on the contact page.
- **Admin Panel**: A password-protected admin dashboard at the  route allows the owner to add, edit, delete, and view vehicle listings and contact messages. The current implementation for adding images requires pasting image URLs.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The user requested to change the admin panel password from the default  to .
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: backend testing agent
    - The agent needs to:
        1.  Edit the  variable in .
        2.  Restart the backend server using backend: stopped
backend: started.
        3.  Test the login endpoint  with  using the new password to confirm the change was successful.
        4. Inform the user of the new password and how to access the admin panel.
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0)**: Change the admin password as requested by the user.

**Issues Detail**:
- **Issue 1**: Change admin password
    - **Attempted fixes**: None. This is the next action to be taken.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Edit the  file.
        2.  Find the line  and change the value to .
        3.  Restart the backend service.
        4.  Verify the change by attempting to log in via the  page or using .
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To fulfill the user's direct request for a custom, more memorable password for their admin panel.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Backend
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1**: Admin Panel Enhancements
    - **Where to resume**: After changing the password, the next logical step is to address the inconvenient image-adding process. The user has already asked about it. The agent should propose building a file upload feature.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: A more user-friendly admin panel that allows the user to directly upload images from their computer instead of pasting URLs.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
    - **Blocked on something**: Awaiting user confirmation to build the feature.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **(P0) Admin Panel Image Uploader**: Build a feature within the admin panel to allow direct file uploads for vehicle images, replacing the current URL-pasting method.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **(P1) Dynamic Sitemap**: The current  is static. It should be dynamically generated to include URLs for all vehicles currently in the database to improve SEO.
    - **(P2) Price Field**: Add a Price field to the vehicle model, backend endpoints, and frontend display (inventory, detail page, admin panel).
    - **(P2) Sold Status**: Enhance the admin panel to allow marking cars as Sold (which would hide them from the public inventory or display a Sold banner) instead of just deleting them.
